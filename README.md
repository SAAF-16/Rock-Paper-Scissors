pc score and the actual round. There are also various comments for every round.I'ts also possible to play from a 
tablet or a mobile phone

## What i've learned
In this project i applied all my current knoledge(14/03/2021) about Html CSS and Javascript, i learned a lot about positioning
objects, using arrays to make the code work in a more "smart" way applying and removing animations through CSS and Javascript,
implementing media querys in an animated enviroment and the use of variables
The biggest struggle, that made me lose most of the time, was to understand how to make the varius objects move as i wanted
problem that i solved using variables (even if the code is much longer)
